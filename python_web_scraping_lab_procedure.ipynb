        "<p>The panelists offered their experiences and recommendations toward a stronger future for civil rights within the local community. They called for action to combat systemic racism — a historical pattern of denying opportunity to fair education, health and housing opportunities in South Bend.</p>\n",
        "<p>“He who wins the war gets to tell the story, so now we believe it all right. Here we are today seeing how that history gets uncovered,” Williams-Preston said.</p>\n",
        "<p>For more than a century, Tardy explained, African Americans have been moving to the north with the intention of looking for jobs after the Great Migration.</p>\n",
        "<p>“We have about 27% of [the] African American population,” Tardy said.</p>\n",
        "<p>However, the promise of labor has quickly shifted to the lack of job opportunities for people of color.</p>\n",
        "<p>“A lot of the families are having difficulty getting places to stay where there is some sort of consistency,” Tardy said.</p>\n",
        "<p>As mentioned in the panel, South Bend’s eviction rate is three times the national average. Low wages, prejudiced state policies and lack of affordable housing are the three main explanations for the city’s drastic increase in evictions, Williams Preston explained — and many citizens being displaced are people of color.</p>\n",
        "<p>In addition to the struggles people of color face in finding jobs, Robinson said the systematic racism that exists won’t let these communities break out of that endless loop of neglect.</p>\n",
        "<p>Panelists then discussed the ongoing disparities in the racial education gap, agreeing that the first step in improving the system is acknolwedging that there is an issue: Systematic racism leads to academic underperformance in children of color.</p>\n",
        "<p>“There exists a systematic problem … Black children don’t have less capabilities; the system is against them,” Williams-Preston said.</p>\n",
        "<p>Tardy emphasized the importance of educational resources and of having a strong focus on elementary schools where foundational skills are taught, such as reading and writing. He also stressed increasing accessibility of mental health resources.</p>\n",
        "<p>Robinson spoke of the need for reliable institutions in the education system.</p>\n",
        "<p>“We should hold corporations accountable for educating our children and for acknowledging the things that are not working,” Robinson said.</p>\n",
        "<p>Black-owned businesses struggle to grow because of the lack of support from big institutions and Indiana’s state government, Williams-Preston said.</p>\n",
        "<p>“It’s killing us,” she said.</p>\n",
        "<p>Williams-Preston said young people of color, including students, entrepreneurs and members of the community, are leaving South Bend due to a lack of opportunity.</p>\n",
        "<p>There is also space for improvement in the community of Notre Dame in eradicating “nepotism and favoritism,” Williams-Preston said. She argued that Notre Dame should support Black community efforts in “mining [their] gold” from the Westside Black communities in order to make them feel more connected.</p>\n",
        "<p>Panelists also suggested efforts to improve cooperation between local businesses and Notre Dame, including direct funding from the University in supporting local small Black-owned businesses. Efforts such as these, Williams-Preston explained, would provide much-needed space for business growth, talent training and inclusion within the community.</p>\n",
        "<p>“If we can do that, we won’t even be the first, but that’s the kind of thing Notre Dame needs to invest in &#8230; committing to becoming a leader in this community by investing in cooperative businesses right here at home,” Williams-Preston said.</p>\n",

        "Successful final projects will include two main components:\n",
        "- a well-documented, working Python program written in Jupyter Notebooks\n",
        "- a written reflection (minimum 300 words) that documents how you approached the final project/what you wanted to accomplish via the final project, resources consulted, how you handled challenges you encountered, key takeaways, etc.\n",
        "  * That reflection can come at the end of the Jupyter Notebook or be embedded throughout the Jupyter Notebook, if you want to approach authoring the notebook as a type of tutorial or \"report\".\n",
        "\n",
        "Expect to spend at least 10 hours working on the final project. That includes brainstorming, meeting with instructor/TAs, in-class work time, etc. If you’re working on a project that is not going to take that much time, think about how to add complexity or take on another smaller scale project.\n",

        "So where to start? The instructor and TAs are going to move quickly on getting you feedback on this lab. But your work in Q2, Q7, and Q8 should be the starting place for how you think about and approach the final project. Specifically, think about the kinds of web content you were able to scrape for these questions and how you might further develop, refine, or expand your work.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, these questions asked you to develop an outline for specific types of webscraping programs. \n",
        "- One next step for the final project could be selecting 1-2 of these programs and further developing or refining the code.\n",
        "- Another next step (especially if you were able to develop working programs for these questions) is to think about how you could expand or extend these workflows to multiple web pages or other web data sources.\n",
        "- A third option for next steps would involve thinking expansively about how you could apply the concepts and approaches covered in this lab to a different type of data source/structure. \n",
        "\n",
        "So in the interim, as you're waiting for feedback on this lab, think about where you could go next with expanding and extending your work in this lab, and start to flesh out or develop some of your own ideas about where you put your time and effort as you work on the final project.\n",
        "\n",
        "Contact the instructor with questions."
